This is a Mac OS X application that draws mustaches in real time on YouTube videos.

## Requirements

Build the project with Xcode 4.2. It requires Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) to run.

## Bugs

The code that finds direct links to YouTube videos no longer works.

There is a memory leak in the QuickTime player, which cleans itself up when you click on the controls. So do that once in a while.
